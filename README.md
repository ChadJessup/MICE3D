Playing around with MICE in Unity

This is a small Unity project that pulls in the .Net Standard 2.0 NES emulator from [MICE](https://github.com/ChadJessup/MICE) - to
have some silly NES Mario running around on a spinning cube.

The final goal was to hook up Unity's new machine learning agents up to this, but I wanted a solid NES emulator first.

Below are some giant debug-mode level slower than slow examples of this masterpiece of emulation and 3d:
